WSAPI ( http://keplerproject.github.com/wsapi )

Overview

WSAPI is an API that abstracts the web server from Lua web applications.
By coding against WSAPI your application can run on any of the supported
servers and interfaces (currently CGI, FastCGI and Xavante, on Windows
and UNIX-based systems).

WSAPI provides a set of helper libraries that help with request processing and
output buffering. You can also write applications that act as filters that
provide some kind of service to other applications, such as authentication,
file uploads, request isolation, or multiplexing.

WSAPI's main influence is Ruby's Rack framework, but it was also influenced
by Python's WSGI (PEP 333). It's not a direct clone of either of them, though, and
tries to follow standard Lua idioms.

WSAPI is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1

Status
Current version is 1.3.4. It was developed for Lua 5.1.

Download
WSAPI can be downloaded from its LuaForge page. You can also get WSAPI using
LuaRocks:

luarocks install wsapi

Latest Sources and Bug Tracker
WSAPI CVS and bug tracker are available at its Github page.

History

WSAPI 1.3.4 [23/Mar/2010]
    * Bugfix release, fix bug introduced by previous fix :-)

WSAPI 1.3.3 [22/Mar/2010]
    * Bugfix release, fix memory leak with reload option for persistent loaders

WSAPI 1.3.2 [19/Mar/2010]
    * Bugfix release, do not send Transfer-Encoding header unless it is
      raw HTTP response

WSAPI 1.3.1 [19/Mar/2010]
    * Bugfix release, fix the unknown symbol in lfcgi.getenv()

WSAPI 1.3 [18/Mar/2010]
    * Fixed segmentation fault when non-string is provided to lfcgi.getenv() (thanks to mkottman@github)
    * Added CGILua bootstrap to wsapi.sapi, so CGILua can run without a kepler_init module present
    * Added an `extra_vars` paremeter to wsapi.xavante.makeHandler and wsapi.xavante.makeGenericHandler, to
      let you pass extra variables in the WSAPI environment
    * Added `overwrite` option to wsapi.request that tells the parameter parser to overwrite repeated parameters
      instead of collecting them in a list    
    * Added a parameter `isolated` to the persistent generic loaders that controls whether you isolate
      each script in a Lua state or not
    * Added parameters to the persistent generic loaders that let the user control the life cycle of Lua
      states: `period` sets how long WSAPI should wait between collecting stale states, and `ttl` sets the
      period after which a state becomes stale
    * Fixed bug in wsapi.ringer that didn't let you use wsapi.input:read inside the response iterator
    * Parameter `vars` for the WSAPI generic loaders that which variables WSAPI should check to get the physical
      path of the script, and in which order. Defaults tro trying SCRIPT_FILENAME first and PATH_TRANSLATED second

WSAPI 1.2 [27/Oct/2009]
    * Adds time-based collection of Lua states to FCGI and Xavante launchers
    * Adds "wsapi" laucher script, to start a Xavante WSAPI server
    * Fixed "undefined media type" error
    * Added is_empty utility function to check if a string is nil or ''
    * Fixed bug with empty bodies in wsapi.xavante, and added full http status codes to responses 
    * Changing order of evaluating PATH_TRANSLATED and SCRIPT_FILENAME, to make non-wrapped launchers work in OSX Apache
    * Reload support for load_isolated_launcher
WSAPI 1.1 [04/Feb/2009]
    * Adds options table to wsapi.request.new, *delay_post* option delays POST processing until req:parsepostdata() is called
    * Moves call to lfs.setmode from wsapi.common to wsapi.cgi
    * Adds wsapi.util.make_rewindable(wsapi_env) method - wraps wsapi_env in a new environment that lets you process the POST data more than once.
    * Correctly handles PATH_TRANSLATED and SCRIPT_FILENAME in case the web server gets creative
    * Statically links the FastCGI version on Windows
WSAPI 1.0 [18/May/2008]
    * First public version.
    * Includes CGI, FastCGI and Xavante WSAPI connectors.
